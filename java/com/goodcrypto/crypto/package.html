The Open Crypto Engine (OCE) provides a common API to crypto engines
such as GPG, PGP, and Bouncy Castle.

<p>
Because the crypto is pluggable, you can instantly switch underlying crypto packages.
Using a single API, you can even nest encryption by different packages.
If just one of the crypto packages is secure, so is your message.
To use nested encryption you may need an OCE application at both ends.

<p>
You can use the crypto plugins either directly or through a CORBA interface.

<p>
OCE is intended primarily for OpenPGP email and file encryption.
It uses some library classes from GoodCrypto.
